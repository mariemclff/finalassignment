# finalassignment

- One of our team members is visually impared, so we always checked the accessibility of our website with a screen reader to make sure she could understand it.
- As exchange students already on our last year of bachelor, we thought it would be more relevant to write about our experience living and studying in a foreign country, especially Norway.This is why we did not talk about being a first year student, because this was two years ago for us. We still wrote managing the workload.
