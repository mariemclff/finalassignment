                    For us, student life this semester is different because all members of our team are international students who have come to Norway for just one semester to experience student life at a university other than their home.
                    We have been studying for several years and the world of coding is not new to us. Rather than that, a new challenge in our lives, at the beginning of this semester, was to move to a new country, with a different culture and especially with a different weather than the one back home. At the same time, student life abroad challenged us to live away from family and friends, which forced us to find new friends here in Norway.
                    due to the fact that we are in a capital, the possibilities of study and free time are many and that is why our life in Oslo was not as "cold" as the weather here. OsloMet has created an environment for us to work in groups on different subjects, which has helped us to meet new people, to have colleagues from Norway and thus integrate more easily into the Nordic landscape.

            <h2 class="title">Managing the workload</h2>
            <p>In our student life, here at OsloMet, we had to choose for ourselves how much time we dedicate to the study, assignment  or projects we have to deliver at the end of the semester. Fortunately, most assignments for different subjects are group assignments that make our work easier.
                First of all, we can divide our work, so, the amount of work for each person is thus smaller. communication is very important for us because we want to make sure that everything goes well as a team and that in the end, we will be able to deliver a good result. Of course, each of us has to work separately on other projects that he/she has to prepare for other subjects, where it is not possible to work in a team. for some of us it is more demanding to work alone because you may not have anyone to consult with international your work. others see it as an advantage because you can organize your time the way you want, feeling that you are more efficient when there are no other people involved in your work.
              Our workflow:
              We believe that teamwork also brings us many beautiful things. Most of the time, we meet physically in the first part of the day and work until the afternoon. we drink our coffee together And so we build the perfect environment to start the brainstorm for what we are going to work on and how we will divide our work. after a few hours, we take a lunch break when we try to detach ourselves from work, and we start all kinds of discussions international the different cultures we come from. when we consider that we have recharged our batteries, we return to work and try to see how we can put together what each of us has worked on. the working day ends when we have carefully analyzed the stage of our project, what we have to do in the future and when we are going to meet for the next step.</p>
