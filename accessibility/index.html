                    We were always focusing on the principles of universal design to make sure our website complies with the level AA criteria of WCAG. We were always checking the accessibility of our pages using WCAG in order to be sure that all our content is accessible to all different users.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Were focused on the positioning of all the elements from the pages, structuring them in a logical order, so that a screen reader could read them in that correct order. We also realized from the previous assignments that there should be enough contrast between the color of the text and the color that appears when pressing the link.

           <p>For users with cognitive issues and learning disabilities, we:
               <ul>
                   <li>Created our pages providing simple navigation and page layouts;</li>
                   <li>Used simple sentences;</li>
                   <li>Avoided moving, blinking, or flickering content.</li>
               </ul>
           </p>
           <p>For the accessibility of the visually impaired users, we:
            <ul>
                <li>Provided consistent, predictable navigation (for keyboard navigation), by creating only the structure of the pages in the HTML code, and no styling elements;
                    Styling our pages only in the CSS file;</li>
                <li>Chose the colors so that the text and images have sufficient contrast between foreground and background (color contrast is at least 4.5:1): for this particular issue, we added a colour outline to our titles to make it more readable since the image obscured the text;</li>
                <li>Avoided the combinations of colors that create difficulties for people with color blindness;</li>
                <li>Made sure to not use color alone to identify the links on our pages, by underlining the links;</li>
                <li>Created equivalent text alternatives for all the images;</li>
                <li>Considered resizing page layouts in order to make it accessible for different sizes of screen displays;</li>
                <li>Placed the navigation elements so that they are consistent throughout the site;</li>
                <li>Creating headings that are used in a logical order.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, we made sure that the navigability provided ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. We also assured that web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
