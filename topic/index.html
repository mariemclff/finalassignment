        <h1 class="title">Reflection on the link between facial recognition development and societal values</h1>

        <div class="data1100">
                <p>When we started discussing facial recognition technology, the first thought that came to our minds was the way
                    we use facial recognition for various tasks on our phones. For example, we use it to unlock our phone or to 
                    verify payments made via banking apps, while still keeping a certain level of security. That’s because facial
                    recognition is developing in a way that it’s become harder and harder to bypass. For example, when your eyes
                    are closed or when you are not looking at the screen, Face-ID will not unlock your phone. Our second topic of 
                    conversation was related to the increased surveillance by our governments in response to terrorist attacks.
                    It raised an important question: How much privacy are we willing to give up in order to prevent another terrorist
                    attack? We briefly talked about the recent attacks in Paris and Brussels and the debate it raised on facial
                    recognition. For instance, according to security experts, had facial recognition technology been properly implemented, 
                    the security forces could have been alerted of the bombers at Brussels airport. But facial recognition is not yet as
                    effective as humans, since camera’s can be avoided by wearing headgear. This also raised another question: Can we trust 
                    our governments that increased surveillance will not be used for other purposes? China for instance, has a high level
                    of mass surveillance and security programmes: Their “Social Credit System” keeps track of businesses and individuals
                    to evaluate their level of trust. But it seems the citizens of China are willing to accept the increased
                    surveillance because it could lower criminal activity and increase national security. On one hand, facial
                    recognition might seem like a convenient technology in everyday usage, but we must consider all the possibilities
                    it gives to companies and governments, and ask ourselves if we want to hand over our privacy to them.</p>
